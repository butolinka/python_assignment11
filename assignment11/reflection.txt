Static vs. interactive visualizations:
Static visualizations are like screenshots—they show data clearly but don’t let you explore it.
Interactive ones let you click around, zoom in, and filter, which makes it easier to understand 
and find patterns.

Advantages of dashboards:
Dashboards are super helpful for real-time data because everything updates live.
You can see what’s happening right away and make fast decisions without digging through reports.


Plotly and Dash in professional settings:
Tools like Plotly and Dash make it easier to share data in a way people can actually use.
Instead of just showing numbers, they let others interact with the data, which makes meetings
and reports more engaging and clear.
